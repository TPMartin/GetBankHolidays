# GetBankHolidays
Console app just to get bank holiday data from gov.uk at https://gov.uk/bank-holidays.json, then Deserialize's the data and pulls out the bank holidays for England and Wales. Needed this for another project that tracks SLA's during work hours which shouldnt run on bank holidays, so needed a way to get a list of dates that will be bank holidays.
